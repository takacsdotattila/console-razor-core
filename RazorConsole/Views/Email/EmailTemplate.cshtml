@model RazorConsole.Model.EmailModel
@{
    Layout = "_EmailLayout";
}

Hello @Model.To,

<p>
    This is a generic email about something...<br />
    It also contains some content that is generated by a partial view.<br />
    @{
        await Html.RenderPartialAsync("Email/EmailPartial");
    }

    And here is some other text: @Model.Text
    <br />
</p>
